# Lauda_Proline_IOC
A Caproto IOC for basic control of the Lauda Proline RP855C bath.

This project implements an EPICS IOC for interfacing with the Lauda Proline RP855 device over a network using their simple ASCII protocol. The IOC is built using [Caproto](https://github.com/caproto/caproto) and Python's asynchronous features to communicate with the device over a TCP/IP socket.

## Features

- **EPICS Process Variables (PVs):**  
  Defines multiple PVs for setting and reading device parameters (e.g., temperature setpoint, bath temperature, operating mode, and program selection).

- **Periodic Scanning:**  
  Several PVs are updated periodically (every 15 seconds) using Caproto's scan decorators to ensure the IOC reflects the current device status.

- **Input Validation and Logging:**  
  Validates IP address and port inputs; includes logging at INFO and DEBUG levels for monitoring device communication.

## Available IOC PVs

| PV Name         | Description                                                  | Scannable?                     |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **TSET**        | Temperature setpoint (write-only)                            | Yes (output in TSET_RBV)          |
| **TSET_RBV**    | Setpoint readback (updates via scan, based on command \`IN_SP_00\`) | No                            |
| **T_RBV**       | Bath temperature readback (updates via scan, based on command \`IN_PV_00\`) | Yes                            |
| **Run**         | Chiller operating mode control (write-only)                  | Yes (output in Run_RBV)          |
| **Run_RBV**     | Operating mode readback (updates via scan, based on command \`IN_MODE_02\`) | No                            |
| **RMP**         | Run program selection (values 1-5, write-only)               | Yes (output in RMP_RBV)          |
| **RMP_RBV**     | Readback of selected run program (updates via scan, based on command \`RMP_IN_05\`) | No                            |
| **RMP_Run**     | Start/Stop selected program control (write-only)             | Yes (output in RMP_Run_RBV)          |
| **RMP_Run_RBV** | Program run state readback (updates via scan, based on command \`RMP_IN_05\`) | No                            |

*Note:* The scan methods for readback PVs update every 15 seconds by default. Adjust the period if needed.

## Dependencies

- **Python 3.11+**  
- **Caproto:** EPICS communication framework ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/caproto/caproto))
- **attrs:** For cleaner class definitions ([Documentation](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/))
- Standard libraries: \`asyncio\`, \`socket\`, \`logging\`, \`sys\`, \`datetime\`

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lauda-ioc.git
   cd lauda-ioc
   \`\`\`

2. **(Optional) Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

   \`\`\`bash
   python3 -m venv .venv &&
   source .venv/bin/activate
   \`\`\`

3. **Install Required Packages:**

   \`\`\`bash
   pip install caproto attrs
   \`\`\`

## Configuration

The IOC accepts the target device's IP address and port as command-line arguments. Default values are provided in the code but can be overridden.

## Usage

To start the IOC, run:

\`\`\`bash
python LaudaProlineIOC.py --prefix Lauda: --list-pvs --host <DEVICE_IP> --port <PORT_NUMBER>
\`\`\`

For example:

\`\`\`bash
python lauda_ioc.py --prefix Lauda: --list-pvs --host 172.17.1.14 --port 4014
\`\`\`

The IOC will connect to the Lauda Proline RP855 device and begin periodic scanning to update readback PVs.

## Logging

Logging is configured to display INFO-level messages by default. Modify the logging configuration in the source code if you require additional debug output.
